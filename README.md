# Calculator
The programm can parse and calculate different mathematical expressions.


## What programm can do?:
- calculate the simplest arithmetic operations: "+", "-", "*", "/", "%", "!", "p" (exponentiation p), "s" (sqrt)
- set and use variable values
- parse expressions with brackets and various mathematical expressions including all possible arithmetic operations and setted variables

## How to use it?:
- use ";" in the end of the string (!!!)
- to calculate simple mathematical expression just type it
- to use variables you need to set them first
- to set variables you need to type "let [variable_name] = [value];"
- *variable_name* can be only one (lowercase or uppercase) letter (but not "p" or "s" as it is already in list of arithmetic operations)
- to change variable value use "let [variable_name] = [value];" again

## Some examples of usage:
